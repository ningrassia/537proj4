Project 4 for cs 537 - I/O timing!

Let's allow the user to specify what writes should take place, and where to output the timing info.

TODO:
Fix the looping structure
Open/close files within each thing.
Generate temp filenames with tempnam!

Extra credit ideas:
Print out some file system info with the time stuff.
Actually do the math in the program, rather than just dumping the data.
Use rdtsc? But we would need to figure out how to get the actual clock speed.
